## Why

I usually search in google or stackoverflow when I'm stuck while coding.<br>
Sometimes their answers lead me to third-party blogs.<br>
I won't say they are "always" helpful.<br>
But when I find informative answers I really thank the author.<br>
Also, they really motivate me to write posts like them.<br>
I'm not a perfect programmer, but I think it will be great if I can share my knowledge and experience with others and get some feedbacks.

## What

I will be posting about things I've studied, experienced and how I solved them. &#9997;<br>

## When

I will be posting probably 1 time a week.
